feedback_generator: calculate new feedback level, output new feedback level by smoothly ramping from the current one

inlet: 
1: current "grain" level for rolling feedback
2: current "depth" level for rolling feedback
3: new error (0 to 4)
4: bang on key position change
outlet: 
1: ramp value for "grain" level
2: ramp value for "depth" level
3: "velocity level" (CURRENTLY UNCHANGED)

Controls: ramp time (currently 250 ms), triplets for each feedback level

-----------------------------------------------

chrono: start/stop clock for a single trial, output timestamps on key position change

inlet:
1: pointer down/up ( -> start/stop clocker)
2: key position change ( -> output current timestamp + reset clocker)
3: reset command ( -> reset clocker and currently stored value)
outlet:
1: timestamp

-----------------------------------------------

feedback_modes: generate a list of integers, to be used to select a feedback modality
currently 4 modalities: A, H, A+H, V  and 12 trials (3 for each)
problems: 
1 - where to locate V trials?
2 - how to ensure two consecutive trials have not the same modality (check and correct createtrials.js)
