Piezo sounds masked with pink noise in headphones.   

key = (column, row) left to right, top to bottom


I - frequency 100 Hz, amplitude 1.0x

column 1 definitely less powerful than the others
(1,2) sensibly less powerful than the rest of column 1
(6,1) almost unperceivable, very low response, sometimes stuttering
(6,2) audible vibration is at higher freq than the other keys, no difference in haptics
(6,4) stronger than (6,3) and (6,5)
(8,1) < (8,2) < the rest of column 8
column 10 slightly less powerful than columns 9 and 11 (maybe same reason of 15 and 16)
columns 15 and 16 make white noise on pressing, even without feedback. With feedback, vibration is less deep (i.e. as it was driven by higher frequencies)
(20,5) less powerful than the rest of column 20
(24,2) less powerful than the rest of column 24
(27,3) less powerful than the rest of column 27
(28,4) less powerful than the rest of column 28


II - frequency 100 Hz, amplitude 2.0x

same as I; (6,1) the most problematic


III - frequency 230 Hz, amplitude 1.5x

column 1 same as trial I
(3,2) less powerful than the rest of column 3
column 6 same as trial I
(7,5) less powerful than the rest of column 7
column 8 same as trial I
column 10 same as trial I; sometimes (9,1) and (11,1) can trigger (10,1)
columns 15 and 16 same as trial I
(20,5) less powerful than the rest of column 20
(24,2) less powerful than the rest of column 24
(26,3) less powerful than the rest of column 26
(27,3) less powerful than the rest of column 27
(28,4) less powerful than the rest of column 28
